# üì¶ Parcel Delivery System

## üöÄ Project Overview
The Parcel Delivery System is a web application that allows senders to create and track parcels, while receivers can manage delivered parcels by marking them as **Received** or **Returned**.  

The platform provides role-based access:
- **Sender**: Create and send parcels with delivery and pickup details.
- **Receiver**: View delivered parcels, acknowledge receipt, or return items.
- **Admin**: Manage users and oversee parcel operations.  

The system ensures **real-time parcel status tracking**, smooth user experience, and scalable APIs to support parcel management workflows.
